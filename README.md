- Hello! My name is Joshua (aka [Blacepos](https://github.com/Blacepos)). I'm a student at Michigan State University.
- You've come across my personal GitHub account. I also have another account for college work [JoshuaRAustin](https://github.com/JoshuaRAustin).
- Iâ€™m mostly interested in desktop development.
- The languages I am most familiar with are (in no particular order): Python, C++, Lua, Rust, Haskell, Javascript, and C#.  
- Right now, I am learning how to translate my C++ experience to the more modern language, Rust.

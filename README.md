- Hello! My name is Joshua (aka [Blacepos](https://github.com/Blacepos)). I'm a student at Michigan State University.
- You've come across my personal GitHub account. I also have another account for college work [JoshuaRAustin](https://github.com/JoshuaRAustin).
- The languages I am most familiar with are (in no particular order): Python, C++, Lua, Rust, Haskell, Javascript, and C#.  
- Right now, I am learning how to translate my C++ experience to the more modern language, Rust.

My [friend](https://github.com/cmulholla) and I went to our first hackathon, Spartahack 8 on January 28th! We made a really cool app called AutoNote and we even won one of the prizes (Best use of MongoDB)! It was such a fun experience and I leared so much about web development. You can check out our project at https://devpost.com/software/autonote-woigte.
